Wild Rice Pilaf

Serves 4 very generously as a main holiday side, 8 if there's stuffing too


Ingredients

- 150 g wild rice (~3/4 cup)
- 150 g white basmati rice (~3/4 cup)[1]
- 100 g leek (about half of a 1" diameter x 18" long leek)
- 100 g celery (a couple ribs)
- 2 cloves garlic
- 900 mL chicken or vegetable stock (~3 3/4 cups)[2]
- 25 g dried mushrooms (a big handful)[3]
- 2 bay leaves
- 2 tsp dried thyme
- 1/2 tsp ground black pepper
- 100 g hazelnuts (~1 cup)
- vegetable oil


Prep

* Slice leek into half-rings, put into a colander, and wash thoroughly[4].
* Chop celery into fine dice, including the leaves if it has them.
* Chop or break mushrooms into ~1/2" chunks.
* Mince garlic.
* Toast hazelnuts in a dry skillet. Let them cool, chop coarsely, and set aside[5].


Cook

* Put a big glug of oil into a pot that holds at least 2.5 liters[6].
* Add both rices and stir over medium-high heat until it smells toasty and starts to make a few popping noises but isn't browning yet.
* Add the leek, celery, and garlic, and keep sauteeing until they start to soften a little bit.
* Add stock, mushrooms, bay leaves, pepper, and thyme. Stir, taste the liquid, and add salt if needed.
* Reduce heat to a simmer, cover, and cook until the wild rice grains curl and split open, approximately 45 minutes.
* Check liquid level after 30 minutes or so. If nearly gone, add a bit more hot water or stock.
* When grains are split and tender, check liquid level again. If not fully absorbed, remove cover and let simmer on low heat, watching carefully, until excess liquid is gone. 
* When rice is done and liquid is fully absorbed, add hazelnuts and mix by gentle fluffing.
* Serve warm.


Notes

[1] You can use brown long-grained rice instead of white basmati. This gives a slightly heartier taste, but the difference is small because the wild rice flavor still dominates. Using brown rice also has the advantage that it cooks at close to the same speed as the wild rice, so it's easier to judge when the whole dish is done. Brown rice will also use more liquid, but I keep forgetting to measure how much more.

[2] The amount of liquid needed is surprisingly hard to pin down! The wild rice, white rice, and dry mushrooms all take up different amounts and at different rates. Fortunately the texture doesn't rely on precise steam cooking, so it's fine to open the lid and add water or stock as needed, or conversely to uncover the pan and simmer off the extra if it's still too damp after the grains are cooked.

[3] The mushrooms in my family's version are dried morels. If you're lucky enough to forage them yourself or willing to pay through the nose for them, they'll make it transcendent. If not, shiitake from your favorite Asian market are still glorious.

[4] Yes, washing the leek after chopping really is easier than trying to get all the sand out from between the layers beforehand.

[5] You can toast the hazelnuts ahead of time or while the rice is simmering, whichever works better for the rest of your schedule.

[6] I like to use a cast iron dutch oven.
