Sauerkraut as relayed by Kathleen Plunkett-Black 
(I know she got this from another source, but don't know what it is)

- Let cabbages wilt 1 day at room temperature
- Slice dime-thick, including core
- Mix in 5-lb batches, 1/4 cup salt per 5 lbs. Let each batch sit 5 minutes before packing
- ferment 5-6 weeks (if at 68-72 F)
- remove scum every ~2 days

CKB notes 2018-08-05:
Assuming Morton pickling salt, which weighs ~288 g cup (https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/45088482?man=&lfacet=&count=&max=25&qlookup=pickling+salt&offset=&sort=default&format=Full&reportfmt=other&rptfrm=&ndbno=&nutrient1=&nutrient2=&nutrient3=&subset=&totCount=&measureby=&Q379583=48&Qv=1&Q379583=0.25&Qv=1): this is 72 g salt / 2268 g cabbage = 3.17% salt. 

My quick Web searching shows most sources, both scientific and touchy-feely, converging on a recommended salt content of about 2-2.5%.
