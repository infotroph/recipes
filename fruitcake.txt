Fruitcake 2018

2018-12-01: hydrating

Dried fruit, all chopped in ~1/2" chunks:
Pineapple 155 g
Apple 40
Pear 36
Peach 41
Apricot 153
Prune 52
Raisin 174
Fig 160
Date 200
= 1011 g total

Soaked in rum (Ron Abuelo Anejo) to rehydrate. Did not measure, but maybe approximately 1 cup.
Fruit sat 3 days, but all rum absorbed within 1. Overnight would probably have been enough, 24 hours definitely sufficient.

2018-12-04: assembling and baking.

Batter, loosely based on Joy of Cooking "Dark Fruitcake" recipe:

Mix dry:
	white flour 160 g 
	whole spelt flour 160 g 
	baking powder 1 tsp ~= 4 g 
	baking powder 1/2 tsp
	No salt -- JoC calls for 1/4 tsp, but I have salted butter
	cinnamon 1 tsp
	ground nutmeg ~1 tsp (eyeballed)
	ground cloves ~3/4 tsp (eyeballed)

Cream together wet:
	salted butter, softened, 250 g (would use unsalted if I had it)
	brown sugar 2 cups packed = 400 g
	6 eggs, one at a time (emulsion broke while adding these!)
	molasses 1/2 cup = 176 g (Nervous this is too much -- revisit this after tasting)
	juice from 1 lemon = 55 g
	apple cider 1/2 cup = 100 g
	candied lemon peel, finely chopped, 9 g

* Added dry to wet in 3 batches. (JoC calls for 1/2 cup brandy in two batches between dry additions here, but I skipped -- seemed wet enough without.)
* Added nuts: 150 g pecans, 150 g walnuts. Both chopped to ~same size as the fruit
* Added fruit
* Divided into 3 pans lined with parchment:
	13x20x5 cm
	14x24x4
	20x20x4, only filled to ~3 cm
	(would have preferred deeper ones if available)
* In oven ~19:20 at 150 C
	20x20x3 out at 21:30 ~= 2hrs
	14x24x4 out at ~22:00 = 2.5
	13x20x5 out at 22:20  = 3 hrs
* Cooled all in pans until midnight, then moved to rack with paper still attached
* Stabbed vertical holes every ~inch with a wooden skewer, poured 2 shots rum slowly over top of each loaf
* Loaf weights after adding *1* shot rum to each:
	20x20x4 848 g
	14x24x4 1030
	13x20x5 1023
* Put in plastic bags, waiting to decide whether to wrap in cheesecloth

Mom's recipe 2018, sent after I started the above

1.  Soak 1 to 11/2 pounds dried fruit in 1-2 c. cider and/or grape juice for 12-24 hours.  (This assumes you are using fruit dry enough to need the soaking.  If your fruit is fairly moist, maybe use more to account for the weight of the liquid being added??)

2. Mix together and simmer 10 minutes, cool several hours:
	2 c. Grated carrot
	3/4 c. oil
	1/2 c. Maple syrup plus 1 Tb molasses

2.5.  Get pans ready:  Oil, then parchment paper 

3. Dry ingredients:
	3 c. Flour
	1/2 tsp salt
	2 tsp baking soda
	2 tsp cinnamon
	1 tsp nutmeg
	1 tsp allspice
	1/2 tsp cloves
	Sometimes have also used 1/2 tsp ground coriander or some dried grated citrus rind.

4. Add 4 beaten eggs to oil-carrot mixture
	Add 1 c almonds and/or other nuts to fruit, and maybe some finely chopped candied ginger
	Another 1 c. Cider

Mix together: 
To oil-carrot mix, add dry ingredients about a third at a time, alternating with the cider.
Fold in fruit mixture.

Bake 2 1/2 to 3 hours in slow oven (250-275ยบ)
Makes 2-3 loaves, depending on the size of your pans.

2019-11-29:

dried fruit in ~1/2" chunks
	Pineapple 120 g
	Fig 150
	Apple 80
	Apricot 230
	Date 230
	Prune 100
	Raisin 200
Added 350 g apple juice + 9 g candied lemon peel (ground to powder -- they were too fossilized to chop), mixed, let soak

2019-11-30:

dry
	160 g whole spelt flour
	160 g white 
	1 tsp baking powder
	1/2 tsp basking soda
	big pinch salt
	1 tsp allspice
	~1/2 tsp cloves
	2 tsp cinnamon
	scant tsp nutmeg

wet
	400 g brown sugar
	250 g unsalted butter
	6 eggs (added 1 at a time)
	80 g molasses
	100 g maple syrup
	juice of 1 lemon = 41 g
	100 g grape juice

Mixed as in 2018
After mixing batter
	150 g chopped walnuts (would use more, but all I had)
	soaked fruit

Spread ~5 cm deep in one 23*13*7 and one 29*14*7 loaf pan, both lined w/parchment

in oven 21:45 at 150 C
11:40: both loaves ~ 180 F. Reduced oven temp to ~ 135 C
12:10: ~200 F
12:28: Still ~200 F, want 205-209
12:35: Tired of waiting. Took both pans out. Justifying: 
	* At least one reading from each loaf is 205 (even if consensus temp closer to 200)
	* thermometer stem comes out clean => passes toothpick test
	* I think I had decided this thermometer reads a few degrees low at the high end, so maybe "200" if 205 anyway
Cooled in pans until 01:00, then moved to rack while still in parchment
