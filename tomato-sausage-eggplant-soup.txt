TOMATO, SAUSAGE, AND
EGGPLANT SOUP 
Makes 3 quarts
Anne helped develop this soup for Eden when it opened
in February 1981. It was so good that we couldn't resist
serving it at The Commissary, too, where we now make
it in 180-quart batches to last three days. Thick and hearty,
the soup is nearly a meal in itself, needing only the company
of some fine crusty bread and a green salad.

1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil 
4 1/2 cups cubed unpeeled eggplant (1/2" cubes)
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 cups chopped onions
1/2 cup chopped fennel or celery
2 tablespoons minced garlic
2 teaspoons ground or crushed fennel seed
1/2 teaspoon pepper
4 bay leaves
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 1/4 teaspoons dried thyme
1 pound sweet Italian sausage with casing removed
1 1/2 cups chicken stock 
1 29-ounce can heavy tomato purée
1 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes, chopped

Heat the 1/3 cup of olive oil in a 4-5 quart saucepan. Add
the eggplant and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt. Sauté over
medium-high heat, stirring frequently, for 4-5 minutes or
until just tender. Transfer the eggplant to a bowl. In the
same pan, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil.
Add the onions, fennel or celery, garlic, fennel seed,
pepper, bay leaves, the remaining teaspoon of salt, basil,
and thyme. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, 
for 5-6 minutes. Add the sausage and sauté 5-6
minutes, breaking up the meat into small pieces with a
spoon. Add the chicken stock, tomato purée, chopped
tomatoes with their juice, and the eggplant. Cover and
simmer 10-15 minutes. If the soup seems too thick, add
more chicken stock. Remove the bay leaves before serving.
