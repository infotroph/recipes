Olive Oil Dough
===============

This versatile, rich dough works nicely in pizza, focaccia, or olive bread.  The
fruitier the olive oil, the better the flavor.

**Makes four 1-pound loaves.  The recipe is easily doubled or halved.**

* 2 3/4 lukewarm water
* 1 1/2 tablespoons granulated yeast (2 packets)
* 1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
* 6 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour

1.  Mix the yeast, sugar, salt, and olive oil with the water in a container.

2.  Mix in the flour without kneading, etc., etc.  If you’re doing this by hand,
    you may need to use wet hands to incorporate the last of the flour.

3.  Cover (not airtight) and allow to rest at room temperature until the dough
    rises and collapses (or flattens on top) -- approximately 2 hours.

4.  The dough can be used immediately after the initial rise, though it is 
    easier to handle when cold.  Refrigerate in a lidded (not airtight)
    container and use over the next 12 days.

For _focaccia_, use a 1-pound lump of dough, shape it as though into a boule, 
place it on an oiled baking sheet, and then flatten it into a 1/2 to 3/4 inch 
thick round, using your hands or a rolling pin and a minimal amount of flour.
Paint/drizzle with olive oil, sea salt, etc., and allow to rest for 20 minutes 
before placing into the oven.  Do the standard thing with the cup of water in 
the broiler tray.  Allow the focaccia to bake for around 25 minutes at 425 °F
-- note that, as you are not using a pizza stone, 20 minutes’ worth of 
preheating is not necessary.
