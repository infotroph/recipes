Fermented pickles, 2016-01-25

1.5 pounds pickling cucumbers. wash, Cut off blossom ends, cut in lengthwise quarters.
7 cloves garlic. peel & lightly smash
3 dried birdseye chilis
~1 tsp dill seed
1 tsp mustard seed

Brine: 
	1 L water
	35 g pickling salt
	2 g calcium chloride

Packed all in short/wide 1/2 gal jar -- fairly loose fit, could have held more. Weighed down top with plastic deli container full of water.

Notes: 

* Cukes came from the reduced produce rack; slightly yellow and a bit limp already. Not ideal starting point, but let's try it! 

* 3.5% salt is from Sandor Katz suggestions: on the low-salt side both because I'm planning for a short fermentation and don't need long keeping time, and because Katz suggests lower salt in cooler conditions (i.e. winter).

* 2 g CaCl is a near-wild guess: extension sources disagree on whether to use CaCl in fermented pickles, but seem to lean towards "not needed" rather than that it's a problem. suggested amount is all over the map, but includes "not more than 1 tsp per gallon of brine" and "3/4 tsp per quart". On my scale, 1 tsp CaCl is ~4.6-4.9 g --> ~(4.8 g/tsp)/(3.785 L/gal) ~= 1.27 g/L, (0.75*4.8 g/tsp)/(0.95 L/qt) = 3.78 g/L. Let's split the difference and make it 0.2%.

2016-01-28: Sampled one pickle. Starting to get sour, but not very salty at all.

2016-01-29: Oops. Plastic container used as weight has holes in the bottom (were those there to start with??), has been leaking unsalted water into brine. 
How badly diluted is it? Best guess: ~3 fills of ~1/2 cup each = 350 mL added = 35 g NaCl / 1350 mL water => brine is now ~2.6% NaCl if well-mixed, not including dilution from cucumbers. Overflow tray contains ~200 mL, which seems consistent with ~350 mL minus evaporation.
Let's bring it back up to around 4% salt: After overflow, jar contains about 1L at 2.6% = 26 g NaCl, want 4% = 40 g/L, so add 40-26 = 14 g salt.
Poured off 500 mL of existing brine, added 14 g salt, shook to dissolve, poured back. Not bothering to correct CaCl concentration.

Broke into these for Boar's Head 2016-02-06 and kept in fridge from then. They were OK 02-06, but a bit better the next week.
