riffing from http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/10/perfect-apple-pie-recipe-double-crusted-thanksgiving-dessert.html
Crust: 
	12.5 oz flour
	2 Tbsp sugar
	1 tsp kosher salt
	2.5 sticks =10 oz butter
	6 Tbsp ice water (I used 8)
	Trick: Reserve 1/3 of flour until rest is fully mixed (Kenji says "to a paste", I stopped while still chunky), *then* add remainder and work little after that.

Filling:
	5 lbs scungy fruit = 3.25 lb slices, v. (v!) approximately 50% apples 50% pears, most slightly underripe. Will need lots of sugar!
	pour 3 qts boiling water over slices, cover, let sit 10 min
	Added 1/4 tsp citric acid just after pouring, no stir
	Drain in colander ~10 min

	Stir in:
		heaping 3/4 cup white sugar
		3 Tbsp cornstarch
		~1/2 tsp cinnamon
		~1/8 tsp cloves
		1/4 tsp orange blossom water

	Let sit until ready to assemble (~1:30 - 2:45)

Filling still seemed VERY sour after sitting. Added another 1/4 cup sugar, poured off all accumulated liquid (~2 cups), boiled down to set starch and concentrate sugar, poured over top of filling just before putting top crust on.

Brushed with egg wash, cooked ~15 min at 425 then __ at 375, both with convection.
