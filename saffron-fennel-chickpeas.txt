Saffron-Fennel Chickpeas

Modified from a tomato-based version that is also worth your time: https://dish.co.nz/recipes/spanish-chickpea-stew-fennel-and-saffron/

You can modify nearly anything about this recipe and get something tasty.
The parts I think are key:
	- lots of fennel flavor
	- go HEAVY on the saffron. The first time I made this I worried I had added too much, then tasted the result and resolved that I would "put too much saffron in everything now."

Dice: 
	4 cloves garlic
	1 carrot
	1 fennel bulb
	Optional: 1 onion (I skip it to match household tastes)
	Optional: stalks from the chard leaves you'll add at the end

Saute in 3 tablespoons coconut oil or butter until the fennel starts to soften.

Add:
	1 teaspoon cumin seeds
	1 teaspoon fennel seeds
	2 cups vegetable stock
	1 bay leaf
	2 big pinches saffron threads 
	3/4 teaspoon smoked paprika
	1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
	4 cups chickpeas, drained and rinsed (two 15-oz/400g cans)
	1/2 of a salt-preserved lemon, chopped very fine (scant quarter-cup after chopping)

Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, simmer until the veggies are very soft.

Five minutes before serving, add:
	1 big handful-of-stems chard, trimmed off the stalks and sliced into ribbons

Cook until the chard just wilts.
Salt and pepper to taste, but do taste first -- that preserved lemon brought a lot of salt with it.
