(As served at Boar's Head Feast 2013. Lightly modified from a recipe in Joy of Cooking, mostly by replacing cornmeal with more rye flour.)

Find two clean 28-oz cans with their bottoms still attached. Make lids for them using double layers of aluminum foil. Grease and lightly flour the insides of both cans and lids.

Have ready a steamer, I.E. any pot large enough to hold both cans, with a trivet or folded towel in the bottom, a tight-fitting lid, and enough boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the cans.

Whisk together:
	1 3/4 cups rye flour
	1 1/4 cup whole wheat flour
	2 teaspoons baking soda
	1 teaspoon salt
	
Whisk together in another bowl:
	2 cups buttermilk
	1 cup currants
	scant 3/4 cup blackstrap molasses
	
 Add the wet ingredients to the dry, stir until well blended, and divide the batter into the cans. Don't fill each can more than two-thirds full. Use kitchen string to tie the foil lids down tightly. Set cans in the steamer, add or remove water until it comes halfway up the sides of the cans, close the lid tightly, and heat on high until the water boils. Adjust heat to a gentle simmer and steam for 3 1/2 hours or until a toothpick stuck into the middle of the loaf comes out clean. Replenish water as needed. When done, move the containers to a cooling rack and let them cool for 20 minutes, then unmold by removing the foil and shaking the loaf out.
